Walker (left, and top right with his daughter Meadow) died after his close friend Roger Rodas lost control of a Porsche GT which smashed into a pole and a tree. The high-powered super-car burst into flames (bottom right) after it crashed in Santa Clarita, north of Los Angeles, at 3.30pm on Saturday. Walker, 40, who was in five of the six films about illegal street racing and heists, had been at an event for his charity Reach Out Worldwide before deciding to take the car out for a drive with his friend.
